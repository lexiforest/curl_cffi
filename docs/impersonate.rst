Impersonate guide
======

Supported impersonate versions, as supported by my [fork](https://github.com/yifeikong/curl-impersonate) of [curl-impersonate](https://github.com/lwthiker/curl-impersonate):

However, only Chrome-like browsers are supported. Firefox support is tracked in [#59](https://github.com/yifeikong/curl_cffi/issues/59).
