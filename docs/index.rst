curl_cffi is a Python binding for `curl-impersonate fork`_ via `cffi`_. For commercial
support, visit `impersonate.pro <https://impersonate.pro>`_.

.. _cffi: https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Unlike other pure Python http clients like ``httpx`` or ``requests``, ``curl_cffi`` can
impersonate browsers' TLS signatures or JA3 fingerprints. If you are blocked by some
website for no obvious reason, you can give this package a try.

If you are looking for Python http3 clients, curl_cffi added http3 support since ``v0.11``.

`Yescaptcha <https://yescaptcha.com/i/stfnIO>`_ is a proxy service that bypasses Cloudflare and uses the API interface to
obtain verified cookies (e.g. ``cf_clearance``). Click `here <https://yescaptcha.com/i/stfnIO>`_
to register.

Features
--------

- Supports JA3/TLS and http2 fingerprints impersonation, including recent browsers and custom fingerprints.
- Much faster than requests/httpx, on par with aiohttp/pycurl, see `benchmarks <https://github.com/lexiforest/curl_cffi/tree/main/benchmark>`_.
- Mimics requests API, no need to learn another one.
- Pre-compiled, so you don't have to compile on your machine.
- Supports ``asyncio`` with proxy rotation on each request.
- Supports http 2.0 & 3.0, which requests does not.
- Supports websocket.

Notes:

1. For pycurl, you need a http/3 enabled libcurl to make it work, while curl_cffi packages libcurl-impersonate inside Python wheels.
2. Since v0.11.4.

Install
-------

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install curl_cffi --upgrade
