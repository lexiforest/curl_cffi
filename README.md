[Documentation](https://curl-cffi.readthedocs.io)

Python binding for [curl-impersonate fork](https://github.com/lexiforest/curl-impersonate)
via [cffi](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). For commercial support, visit [impersonate.pro](https://impersonate.pro).

`curl_cffi` is the most popular Python binding for `curl`. Unlike other pure
python http clients like `httpx` or `requests`, `curl_cffi` can impersonate
browsers' TLS/JA3 and HTTP/2 fingerprints. If you are blocked by some
website for no obvious reason, you can give `curl_cffi` a try.

Python 3.10 is the minimum supported version since v0.14.

TLS fingerprinting alone isn't enough for modern bot protection. [Hyper Solutions](https://hypersolutions.co?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=curl_cffi) provides the missing piece - API endpoints that generate valid antibot tokens for:

Akamai • DataDome • Kasada • Incapsula

No browser automation. Just simple API calls that return the exact cookies and headers these systems require.

## Features

- Supports JA3/TLS and http2 fingerprints impersonation, including recent browsers and custom fingerprints.
- Much faster than requests/httpx, on par with aiohttp/pycurl, see [benchmarks](https://github.com/lexiforest/curl_cffi/tree/main/benchmark).
- Mimics the requests API, no need to learn another one.
- Pre-compiled, so you don't have to compile on your machine.
- Supports `asyncio` with proxy rotation on each request.
- Supports http 2.0 & 3.0, which requests does not.
- Supports websocket.
- MIT licensed.

Notes:

1. For pycurl, you need an http/3 enabled libcurl to make it work, while curl_cffi packages libcurl-impersonate inside Python wheels.
2. Since v0.11.4.

## Install

    pip install curl_cffi --upgrade

This should work on Linux, macOS and Windows out of the box.
If it does not work on you platform, you may need to compile and install `curl-impersonate`
first and set some environment variables like `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

Android support, including Termux, is currently in beta, you can install the beta release for testing.
For BSD systems, we need to get libcurl-impersonate compile first, and then add support in curl_cffi.
If you are using these OSes, please lend an hand.

To install beta releases:

    pip install curl_cffi --upgrade --pre

To install unstable version from GitHub:

    git clone https://github.com/lexiforest/curl_cffi/
    cd curl_cffi
    make preprocess
    pip install .

## Usage

`curl_cffi` comes with a low-level `curl` API and a high-level `requests`-like API.

### requests-like

```python
import curl_cffi

# Notice the impersonate parameter
r = curl_cffi.get("https://tls.browserleaks.com/json", impersonate="chrome")

print(r.json())
# output: {..., "ja3n_hash": "aa56c057ad164ec4fdcb7a5a283be9fc", ...}
# the js3n fingerprint should be the same as target browser

# To keep using the latest browser version as `curl_cffi` updates,
# simply set impersonate="chrome" without specifying a version.
# Other similar values are: "safari" and "safari_ios"
r = curl_cffi.get("https://tls.browserleaks.com/json", impersonate="chrome")

# Randomly choose a browser version based on current market share in real world
# from: https://caniuse.com/usage-table
# NOTE: this is a pro feature.
r = curl_cffi.get("https://example.com", impersonate="realworld")

# To pin a specific version, use version numbers together.
r = curl_cffi.get("https://tls.browserleaks.com/json", impersonate="chrome124")

# To impersonate other than browsers, bring your own ja3/akamai strings
# See examples directory for details.
r = curl_cffi.get("https://tls.browserleaks.com/json", ja3=..., akamai=...)

# http/socks proxies are supported
proxies = {"https": "http://localhost:3128"}
r = curl_cffi.get("https://tls.browserleaks.com/json", impersonate="chrome", proxies=proxies)

proxies = {"https": "socks://localhost:3128"}
r = curl_cffi.get("https://tls.browserleaks.com/json", impersonate="chrome", proxies=proxies)
```

### Sessions

```python
s = curl_cffi.Session()

# httpbin is a http test website, this endpoint makes the server set cookies
s.get("https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/foo/bar")
print(s.cookies)
# <Cookies[<Cookie foo=bar for httpbin.org />]>

# retrieve cookies again to verify
r = s.get("https://httpbin.org/cookies")
print(r.json())
# {'cookies': {'foo': 'bar'}}
```

### Supported impersonate browsers

`curl_cffi` supports the same browser versions as supported by my [fork](https://github.com/lexiforest/curl-impersonate) of [curl-impersonate](https://github.com/lwthiker/curl-impersonate):

Open source version of curl_cffi includes versions whose fingerprints differ from previous versions.
If you see a version, e.g. `chrome135`, were skipped, you can simply impersonate it with your own headers and the previous version.

If you don't want to look up the headers etc, by yourself, consider buying commercial support from [impersonate.pro](https://impersonate.pro),
we have comprehensive browser fingerprints database for almost all the browser versions on various platforms.

If you are trying to impersonate a target other than a browser, use `ja3=...` and `akamai=...`
to specify your own customized fingerprints. See the [docs on impersonation](https://curl-cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/impersonate/_index.html) for details.

|Browser|Open Source| Pro version|

Notes:

1. Added in version `0.6.0`.
2. Fixed in version `0.6.0`, previous http2 fingerprints were [not correct](https://github.com/lwthiker/curl-impersonate/issues/215).
3. Added in version `0.7.0`.
4. Added in version `0.8.0`.
5. Added in version `0.9.0`.
6. The version postfix `-a`(e.g. `chrome133a`) means that this is an alternative version, i.e. the fingerprint has not been officially updated by browser, but has been observed because of A/B testing.
5. Added in version `0.10.0`.
6. Added in version `0.11.0`.
7. Since `0.11.0`, the format `safari184_ios` is preferred over `safari18_4_ios`, both are supported, but the latter is quite confusing and hard to parse.
8. Added in  `0.12.0`.

### Asyncio

```python
from curl_cffi import AsyncSession

async with AsyncSession() as s:
    r = await s.get("https://example.com")
```

More concurrency:

```python
import asyncio
from curl_cffi import AsyncSession

urls = [
    "https://google.com/",
    "https://facebook.com/",
    "https://twitter.com/",
]

async with AsyncSession() as s:
    tasks = []
    for url in urls:
        task = s.get(url)
        tasks.append(task)
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

For low-level APIs, Scrapy integration and other advanced topics, see the
[docs](https://curl-cffi.readthedocs.io) for more details.

### WebSockets

```python
from curl_cffi import WebSocket

def on_message(ws: WebSocket, message: str | bytes):
    print(message)

ws = WebSocket(on_message=on_message)
ws.run_forever("wss://api.gemini.com/v1/marketdata/BTCUSD")
```

### Asyncio WebSockets

```python
import asyncio
from curl_cffi import AsyncSession

async with AsyncSession() as session:
    async with session.ws_connect("wss://echo.websocket.org") as ws:
        await asyncio.gather(*[ws.send_str("Hello, World!") for _ in range(10)])
        async for message in ws:
            print(message)
```

When submitting an PR, please use a different branch other than `main` and check the
"Allow edits by maintainers" box, so I can update your PR with lint or style fixes. Thanks!

### AI Policy

- Using AI is neither encouraged nor discouraged, use it by your own choice.
- The bottom line here is that every line of code should be **reviewed by human**, and should be [proven to work](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/18/code-proven-to-work/).
- It's not guaranteed that AI will come up with the cleanest solution, you are responsible to guide it to the right way you know.
- Fix any lint errors, make sure your code follows the established convention in this project.
- LLM tends to generate extensive or none comments, revise the comments and make sure they are concise and helpful.
- It's absolutely **not acceptable** to generate the entire PR summary by LLM. To communicate with other human, use words from a human.
- The only acceptable exception is to fix grammar issues if you are not a native English speaker.
- The essence here is to keep [Human in the loop](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-llvm-ai-tool-policy-human-in-the-loop/89159)

You can even feed the policy above to your "copilot" to let it adjust the style for you. :P
